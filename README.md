<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->

<!--
**AlynxZhou/AlynxZhou** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

I won't display some info here as what GitHub suggested. You are already in my profile page right? So why don't you just read my info from sidebar?

Also if I want to present myself, I have website hosted via GitHub Pages, which contains CSS, so I can customize it.

Go to <https://alynx.one/> for my personal website, and <https://sh.alynx.one/> for my blog. If you have extra time, try my projects below.

Again, GitHub, or Micro$oft, this is not a useful feature, users cannot write CSS in Markdown files. My website is better than your README in profile, completely.
