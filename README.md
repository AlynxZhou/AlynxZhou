<!-- ### Hi there 👋 -->

<!--
**AlynxZhou/AlynxZhou** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->

I won't display some info here as what GitHub suggested. You are already in my profile page right? So why don't you just read my info from sidebar?

Also if I want to present myself, I have website hosted via GitHub Pages, which contains CSS, so I can customize it.

Go to <https://alynx.one/> for my personal website, and <https://sh.alynx.one/> for my blog. If you have extra time, try my projects below. Wanna contact me? My personal Email is [alynx.zhou@gmail.com](mailto:alynx.zhou@gmail.com).

Again, GitHub, or Micro$oft, this is not a useful feature, users cannot write CSS in Markdown files. My website is better than your README in profile, completely.
